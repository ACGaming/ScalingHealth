Scaling Health
===========

This Minecraft mod started as a port of [Difficult Life](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/difficult-life). Eventually, I decided I would rather break down the existing mod and build my own, fixing bugs and fine-tuning it to my liking, since the authors of Difficult Life seem to be away.

This mod will, by default, allow the player to gain extra health. Mobs will also gain extra health, with the amount increasing gradually over time. Both player and mob health increases can be disabled. The rate at which the difficulty increases can also be changed.

Some of the code is a bit messy, unfortunately. Some functions are more or less direct copies from Difficult Life, so they may need some cleaning up.
