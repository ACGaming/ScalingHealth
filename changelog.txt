0.1.3
Added: Multiple health scaling modes. Defaults to MULTI_HALF.
        - ADD: The old method, adds a flat value based on difficulty.
        - MULTI: Applies a multiplier to health instead, so health increases are proportional to base max health.
        - MULTI_HALF: Same as MULTI, but the multiplier for higher health mobs is lower.
        - MULTI_QUARTER: Same as MULTI_HALF, but the multiplier reduction is even greater (max health is lower than MULTI_HALF and MULTI)
Added: A way to change the hard-coded max health limit (uses ASM, I don't think there's any other way)
Added: An ASM config file that has an option to change the max health cap (config/scalinghealth/asm.cfg). Defaults to 2048, twice the vanilla cap.
Added: A ding sound plays when using a heart container.
Fixed: Some mobs not being healed to the correct health. For real this time!
Fixed: The health modifier for mobs being calculated wrong if other modifiers are present.

0.1.2
Added: Custom health rendering now implemented.
Added: Some attribute modifier debug info. Displayed through WIT (not a dependency)
Changed: Main config file moved to its own folder (config/scalinghealth/main.cfg).
Fixed: Some mobs not having current health set correctly on spawn.
Fixed: Mob attack damage modifiers not being right...
Fixed: Heart Container model not loading.
