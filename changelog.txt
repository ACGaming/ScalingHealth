1.3.4
Fixed: The heart crystal shards -> heart container recipe not working in Forge 2552+

1.3.3
Added: Config to add additional XP to all mobs. Default gives an extra 1% per difficulty. Only works on mobs spawned since this update. (#51)
Added: Config to tweak potions applied to non-blights. You can add/remove effects and specify the minimum difficulty requirement and potion level. This is under the new mob/potion category. If changed in-game, you must restart Minecraft. (#52)
Added: Config to add difficulty to players when sleeping through the night (#53)

1.3.2
Added: Config to replace heart container drops with heart crystal shards.
Added: Config to set blight potion duration. This is just to customize the duration of the lingering effects from blight creeper explosions. Blights will still refresh their potions infinitely. Set to -1 if you want infinite duration from lingering effects.

1.3.1
Added: Config to allow/prevent fake players from getting heart container drops (main/fake_players/Can Generate Hearts)
Added: Config to allow/prevent fake players from accumulating difficulty (main/fake_players/Have Difficulty) (WIP on #48, doesn't really do anything of note right now)
Added: Config to blacklist mob extra health by dimension (main/mob/health/Dimension Blacklist) (#37)
Added: Config for difficulty change on boss kills (main/difficulty/Difficulty Per Boss Kill) (#42)
Added: Config to blacklist all bosses from becoming blights (main/mob/blights/Blacklist All Bosses) (#46)
Added: Color setting for the new health text. GREEN_TO_RED mode (default) displays green at full health and moves to red as you take damage. WHITE is just white. PSYCHEDELIC lets you taste the rainbow.
Changed: Entity blacklists now check for registry names, but the old entity ID's will still match too (#46)

1.3.0
Requires Silent Lib 2.2.9. Cuts support for Minecraft 1.10.2 and 1.11.2.
Added: Bandages and medkits. These items will restore a percentage of your health over a set amount of time. Bandages restore 30% over 60 seconds, and medkits restore 70% over 35 seconds. Movement speed is reduced by 25% while in effect.
Added: Heart dust. Crafted from a heart container and used to craft bandages and medkits. You get 24 dust from each heart, but you can't craft them back.
Added: A small bit of text to the left of hearts. By default (ROWS mode), this will show how many rows of hearts (full and partial) you currently have, but does nothing to indicate your max health. Change to the HEALTH_AND_MAX mode to make the text display your current and max health values (the actual numbers Minecraft stores, so it's in half-hearts). Set to DISABLED to remove the text.
Added: Debug mode now shows all modifiers being applied to your health. If your health isn't coming out to the number you think it should, this might help you figure out which mod(s) are changing it.

1.2.2
Update version range to include 1.12.2.
Fixed: A crash with Metamorph (possibly other unreported crashes?)

1.2.0
Added: Difficulty meter now shows an actual number for the area difficulty.
Added: Config settings for blight equipment (new category: mob/blights/equipment)
Added: Any mob can now receive a single, beneficial potion effect. Chance is configurable, lasts just 10 minutes. It's nothing too crazy.
Added: An API for modders to work with.
Added (API): Getters for area/player difficulty. A method to add difficulty to the player.

1.1.3

Added: es_VE.lang (couresy of Dorzar)

1.1.1
Added: Heart containers now heal (configurable, defaults to 4 (2 hearts), set to 0 to disable)
Added: Config to disable max health increases from heart containers, allowing them to be used exclusively as healing items.
Added: Pet regen. Tamed animals will slowly recover health over time. Set the config to 0 to disable.

Changed: Many difficulty configs can now be set to negative values, allowing far greater control over the difficulty system!
Behind the scenes: Updated the config class to the Silent Lib "AdaptiveConfig". Currently this is not being used for anything, but your config file will now track the last build you used.

Added: Separate config for hearts dropped by passive mobs (defaults to 0.1%, hostile rate is 1%).

1.0.2
Added: "Distance and Time" difficulty mode: adds together the "Weighted Average" and "Distance from Spawn" modes. You may need to adjust some other values in the config to make the increases manageable.
Fixed (1.11 only): Textures not loading.

1.0.1
Added: Configs for difficulty meter (under the client category)
Fixed: Difficulty meter displaying at all times... did that for debugging and forgot to remove it.

1.0.0
Added: A config option to disable blight death messages... What, you don't like seeing "Blight Squid drowned" for the 50th time?
Changed: Improved heart rendering a bit
Fixed: A bug where the config file would fail to load if the length of the heart colors list was changed.

0.2.7
Added: Config option to replace blights being on fire with a particle effect (enabled by default). This is more reliable, as it works on fire-proof mobs. Current effect likely needs work...
Added: Additional configs for blights (fire resistance, invisibility, supercharged creepers).
Changed: Default hearts dropped by blights to 0-2 (up from 0-1, update your configs if desired)

0.2.6
Still attempting to solve a weird crash (see issue #9). Additional info should be dumped to the log.
Added: Blights drop extra XP now (configurable, default 10x).
Changed: Default hearts dropped by blights to 0-1 (down from 1-2). Update your config files!

Fixed: A server crash (java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: net/silentchaos512/scalinghealth/client/HeartDisplayHandler)
Fixed: Heart color configs not being padded with 0's. This had no effect on the behavior of the configs, but could be confusing to users.

Added: Config to specify extra heart colors.
Added: Death message when blights are killed by something other than a player.

Added: Blights now drop heart canisters when killed (1-2 by default)
Changed: Blights while now reignite after a few seconds if their fire goes out.
Changed: Difficulty bar now displays both area and player difficulty (the lower quarter of the bar is player difficulty)
Fixed: A probable crash with the difficulty bar, if max difficulty is zero.
Fixed: Config option to render the difficulty bar being ignored.

0.2.2
Added: A difficulty bar. Displays for a short time occasionally. Feedback appreciated.
Fixed: Health modifiers being wrong when other modifiers are already applied.
Fixed: Heart rendering when player has regen.

0.2.1
Added: Heart Crystal Ore. Drops shards that can be used to craft heart containers...
Added: Group difficulty bonus. The area difficulty increases a bit more for each additional player in the area (configurable)
Added: Idle difficulty increase multiplier. By default, difficulty increase per second is slower when the player is not moving. Set it to a number greater than one is you want faster increase when idle.
Fixed: Player's health displaying incorrectly after traveling between dimensions.
Fixed: Hearts not shaking on low health.
Fixed: Mobs with low health getting a larger boost on "MULTI" health scaling modes.

0.2.0
WARNING: A new save system has been implemented! It should be much more reliable, but your current health and difficulty will reset to default values. Use the "/scalinghealth" command to correct that. Deleting your current main.cfg config file is not required, but recommended.
Added: A player-based difficulty system. Each player will track a difficulty level. Should be good for servers.
Added: Area difficulty modes. When a mob spawns, an "area difficulty" value is calculated. This has several configurable modes, most of which will consider all nearby players to determine the difficulty. There are also options to use distance from the world spawn or origin. By default, a weighted average is used, with the weights being based on the distance of each player from the mob. In other words, the difficulty of closer players has a bigger impact.
Changed: Difficulty per tick changed to per second. Should make the values easier for some people to understand (no e-notation in the default value), and help with rounding errors. To get the value you want, try 'max_difficulty / (hours_to_max_difficulty * 3600)'.
Fixed: Heart containers being consumed at max health.
Possibly Fixed: Some problems with health getting reset. Not tested, but some or all of these issues may have been fixed by the new save system.

0.1.3
Added: Multiple health scaling modes. Defaults to MULTI_HALF.
        - ADD: The old method, adds a flat value based on difficulty.
        - MULTI: Applies a multiplier to health instead, so health increases are proportional to base max health.
        - MULTI_HALF: Same as MULTI, but the multiplier for higher health mobs is lower.
        - MULTI_QUARTER: Same as MULTI_HALF, but the multiplier reduction is even greater (max health is lower than MULTI_HALF and MULTI)
Added: A way to change the hard-coded max health limit (uses ASM, I don't think there's any other way)
Added: An ASM config file that has an option to change the max health cap (config/scalinghealth/asm.cfg). Defaults to 2048, twice the vanilla cap.
Added: A ding sound plays when using a heart container.
Fixed: Some mobs not being healed to the correct health. For real this time!
Fixed: The health modifier for mobs being calculated wrong if other modifiers are present.

0.1.2
Added: Custom health rendering now implemented.
Added: Some attribute modifier debug info. Displayed through WIT (not a dependency)
Changed: Main config file moved to its own folder (config/scalinghealth/main.cfg).
Fixed: Some mobs not having current health set correctly on spawn.
Fixed: Mob attack damage modifiers not being right...
Fixed: Heart Container model not loading.

0.1.1
Changed the way attribute modifiers are applied.

0.1.0
Initial alpha release.
